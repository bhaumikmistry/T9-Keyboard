T9, which stands for Text on 9 keys, is a USA-patented predictive text technology
for mobile phones (specifically those that contain a 3x4 numeric keypad), 
originally developed by Tegic Communications, now part of Nuance Communications.

The current version is based on the normal click algoeithm and not implemented with predictive text.
version 2.0 will have some improvements in algorithm.
